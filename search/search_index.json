Then click on Shapefile to download it: Go to World Population Review website and download the csv files containing the population data of us states. We will need to download two files the 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022.csv' and the 'District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.csv'. After that we can open both files in microsoft excel or we can use a free software called Only Office to copy the data of District of Columbia to the 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022.csv'. Load the data to QGIS Open a new project in QGIS software and add the 'gadm41_USA_1.shp' data file. Now, let's explore the attribute table of the new layer to see its content. As we can see from the picture above the us states are inside a field called 'Name_1'. We will use this name later in the tutorial. Now, let's add the second data file. Click on the Layer menu and choose 'Add Delimited Text Layer' option. A new window will appear, click on the icon nexxt to the File name to choose the 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022.csv' file: Also, In the Geometry Definition make sure to choose the 'No geometry (attribute only table)' option.

Then click on the blue back arrow to go back to the Join Attributes by Field Value window Scroll down to the Joined layer option and click on the button next to it and choose Save to File to save the new joined layer to a shape file. Choose a name to the new layer (like us_state_pop.shp) abd a location of the new file (like on the Desktop). Now, click on Run to run the algorithm. The new layer is added, let's see its attribute table to see the new fields As we can see in the screen above, there are 3 new fields (Pop, Pop2021m Pop2010) added to the main layer. Create a Spatialite database and connect to it using QGIS DB Manager In the QGIS Browser panel rigth click on SpatiaLite and choose Create Database, a new window will appear. Choose a location to save the database and database name (like us_states_pop) then click on save. Now, let's connect to our newly created database.

A new window will appear, Make sure that 'us_state_pop' layer is selected in the Input option, and click on the checkboxes next to Primary Key and Create spatial index options to activate them. The Primary Key option creates a new unique key to each record of the database, we can call the field whatever we like, but in this tutorial I will choose the default value 'id'. The Create spatial index option, is used with spatial data to imorive the queries time. Finally click Ok to load the data. A new table called us_state_pop is added to our database. Click on the Table tab to see its data.","title":"Insert data into the database"},{"location":"tutorials/GIS/Spatial_Databases/SpatiaLite/spatialite/#run-basic-sql-queries-on-the-database","text":"In the DB Manager window, click on the SQL Window, to open the SQL Query window Let's write a SQL query to retrive a record about New York city select * from us_state_pop where Name_1 = \"New York\"; Next, click on Execute to run the query Here is the result: Another example, let's say we want to retrieve the name and population of all the states that have more than 10 million population. select Name_1, Pop from us_state_pop where Pop > 10000000; And that's it for today's tutorial. We can see how easy it is to create, manage and query spatial databases using QGIS. In a later tutorial, we will learn how to create a PostGIS database and query it's content.","title":"Run basic SQL queries on the database"}]}
