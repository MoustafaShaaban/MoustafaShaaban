I had worked as a Customer service representative, Marine surveyor assistant and Data Entry. I am now looking for an opportunity in the field of GIS analysis or the field of data analysis, as I am trying to link what I studied and implemented in the college with the field of data analysis, where there is a great relationship between the two fields, and I also use some web development techniques to do some data visualization and analysis projects about spatial and non-spatial data.

Goal: Calculate the closest route between two points in the city of Dijon using OSM (Open Street Map) free data. Download the required data: Data Sources: GADM Geofabrik First go to GADM website by clicking on the following link GADM and from the Country drop down menu choose France. Then click on Shapefile to download it: Now go to Geofabrik website to download free OSM data exactly the Bourgogne region of France where Dijon city is located by clicking on this link Geofabrik Save the data files and extract the zip files in any location you want (you can leave it in the downloads folder for easy access to it). Step 1: Add the gadm36_FRA_4.shp layer: Step 2: In QGIS window open the Processing menu and click on Toolbox: Step 3: From the Processing Toolbox select Vector selection then Extract by expression option which allows us to extract data to a new layer by using an expression: Step 4: The Extract by expression window will open, now click on the Expression icon: Step 5: In the search box type name, then, double click on the NAME_4 from Fields and Values: Step 6: Now complete the expression as follow (\u201cNAME_4\u201d = \u2018Dijon\u2019) to extract the Dijon city boundaries and then click Ok: Step 7: Click Run to run the algorithm, A new layer called Matching features will be created: Step 8: Turn off the gadm36_FRA_4.shp layer and right click on the Matching features layer then select Zoom to layers to see the result: Step 9: Open the Styling panel to style the newly created layer, then choose the outline blue style: Step 10: Now we can add the second data layer: gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp: Step 11: From the Processing Toolbox > Vector selection choose Extract by location tool: Step 12: The Extract by location window will appear. In the Extract features from choose the gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp layer. And in the Where the features (geometric predicate) check only (are within) option, and in By comparing to the features from choose the Matching features layer, then click Run: Step 13: Turn off the gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp layer to see the results well: Step 14: Now we can choose a good style for our new layer, back to the styling panel choose the Topo road style for the Extracted (location layer) : Step 15: Now, It\u2019s time for the Network analysis (Shortest path point to point), Back the Processing Toolbox > Network Analysis > Shortest path (point to point): Step 16: Make sure that the Extracted (location) layer is selected as the Vector layer representing network, and then click on the icon next to the Start point to pick a start point from the layer, then do the same for the End point: Step 17: In the Advanced parameter, choose the oneway field as the Direction field, and F for the Value for forward direction, T for Value for backward direction, and B for Value for both directions, Finally click Run to run the algorithm : Step 18: A new layer called Shortest path will be created, let\u2019s choose a different style like (Topo main road) so we can see it: Step 19: That\u2019s it, Here is the Shortest path between the start and end point that we picked!
