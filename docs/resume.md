# Summary
---------
* Graduated from faculty of Arts department of Geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Alexandria
University.

* I had worked as a Customer service representative, Marine surveyor assistant and Data Entry.

* I am now looking for an opportunity in the field of GIS analysis or the field of data analysis, as I am trying to link
what I studied and implemented in the college with the field of data analysis, where there is a great relationship
between the two fields, and I also use some web development techniques to do some data visualization and
analysis projects about spatial and non-spatial data.
