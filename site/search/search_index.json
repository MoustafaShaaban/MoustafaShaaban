I had worked as a Customer service representative, Marine surveyor assistant and Data Entry. I am now looking for an opportunity in the field of GIS analysis or the field of data analysis, as I am trying to link what I studied and implemented in the college with the field of data analysis, where there is a great relationship between the two fields, and I also use some web development techniques to do some data visualization and analysis projects about spatial and non-spatial data.

Download the required data: Data Sources: GADM Geofabrik First go to GADM website by clicking on the following link GADM and from the Country drop down menu choose France. Then click on Shapefile to download it: Now go to Geofabrik website to download free OSM data exactly the Bourgogne region of France where Dijon city is located by clicking on this link Geofabrik Save the data files and extract the zip files in any location you want (you can leave it in the downloads folder for easy access to it). Step 1: Add the gadm36_FRA_4.shp layer: Step 2: In QGIS window open the Processing menu and click on Toolbox: Step 3: From the Processing Toolbox select Vector selection then Extract by expression option which allows us to extract data to a new layer by using an expression: Step 4: The Extract by expression window will open, now click on the Expression icon: Step 5: In the search box type name, then, double click on the NAME_4 from Fields and Values: Step 6: Now complete the expression as follow (\u201cNAME_4\u201d = \u2018Dijon\u2019) to extract the Dijon city boundaries and then click Ok: Step 7: Click Run to run the algorithm, A new layer called Matching features will be created: Step 8: Turn off the gadm36_FRA_4.shp layer and right click on the Matching features layer then select Zoom to layers to see the result: Step 9: Open the Styling panel to style the newly created layer, then choose the outline blue style: Step 10: Now we can add the second data layer: gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp: Step 11: From the Processing Toolbox > Vector selection choose Extract by location tool: Step 12: The Extract by location window will appear. In the Extract features from choose the gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp layer.

Steps Download the required data Load the data to QGIS Create a table join between using (Join Attributes by Field Values) algorithm Create a Spatialite database and connect to it using QGIS DB Manager Insert data into the database Run basic SQL queries on the database Download the required data: Data Sources: GADM World Population Review First go to GADM website by clicking on the following link GADM and from the Country drop down menu choose United States. Then click on Shapefile to download it: Go to World Population Review website and download the csv files containing the population data of us states. We will need to download two files the 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022.csv' and the 'District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.csv'. After that we can open both files in microsoft excel or we can use a free software called Only Office to copy the data of District of Columbia to the 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022.csv'. Load the data to QGIS Open a new project in QGIS software and add the 'gadm41_USA_1.shp' data file. Now, let's explore the attribute table of the new layer to see its content. As we can see from the picture above the us states are inside a field called 'Name_1'. We will use this name later in the tutorial. Now, let's add the second data file. Click on the Layer menu and choose 'Add Delimited Text Layer' option. A new window will appear, click on the icon nexxt to the File name to choose the 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022.csv' file: Also, In the Geometry Definition make sure to choose the 'No geometry (attribute only table)' option. Then click Add. A new layer is added to the Layers panel. Create a table join between using (Join Attributes by Field Values) algorithm From the QGIS toolbar click on Processing menu and choose Toolbox. In the Processing Toolbox search bar type 'table join' and double click on 'Join attributes by field value' under the Vector general tools to open it. The Join Attributes by Field Value window will appear. In the Input layer option choose the 'gadm41_USA_1' layer. And in the Table field option choose 'Name_1': In the Input layer 2 option make sure it has our second layer 'US states - Ranked by Population 2022' and then, click on the Table field 2 to choose the field that contains the US States 'State' Click on the button next to the 'Layer 2 fields to copy (leave empty to copy all fields) optional' to choose the fields we want to join in our case we need 3 fields (Pop, Pop2021, Pop2010) click on the checkboxes next to those fields. Then click on the blue back arrow to go back to the Join Attributes by Field Value window Scroll down to the Joined layer option and click on the button next to it and choose Save to File to save the new joined layer to a shape file. Choose a name to the new layer (like us_state_pop.shp) abd a location of the new file (like on the Desktop). Now, click on Run to run the algorithm. The new layer is added, let's see its attribute table to see the new fields As we can see in the screen above, there are 3 new fields (Pop, Pop2021m Pop2010) added to the main layer. Create a Spatialite database and connect to it using QGIS DB Manager In the QGIS Browser panel rigth click on SpatiaLite and choose Create Database, a new window will appear. Choose a location to save the database and database name (like us_states_pop) then click on save. Now, let's connect to our newly created database. In the QGIS toolbar open Database > DB Manager The Database Manager window will open. From the Providers panel expand SpatiaLite > us_states_pop to connect to the database. Insert data into the database From the Datebase Manager window click on the 'Import Layer File' button to insert a layer file to the database. A new window will appear, Make sure that 'us_state_pop' layer is selected in the Input option, and click on the checkboxes next to Primary Key and Create spatial index options to activate them. The Primary Key option creates a new unique key to each record of the database, we can call the field whatever we like, but in this tutorial I will choose the default value 'id'. The Create spatial index option, is used with spatial data to imorive the queries time. Finally click Ok to load the data. A new table called us_state_pop is added to our database. Click on the Table tab to see its data. Run basic SQL queries on the database In the DB Manager window, click on the SQL Window, to open the SQL Query window Let's write a SQL query to retrive a record about New York city select * from us_state_pop where Name_1 = \"New York\"; Next, click on Execute to run the query Here is the result: Another example, let's say we want to retrieve the name and population of all the states that have more than 10 million population. select Name_1, Pop from us_state_pop where Pop > 10000000; And that's it for today's tutorial.
